# JobsBG

JobsBG is an open-source project made by me. 

This project would be a simple job board project listing website similar to jobs.bg, but a simplified version, of course. The project would have a landing page listing all jobs, a simple admin area for editing jobs submissions.

## Requirements
* Simple PHP project that will have the following functionality:
  * A simple Job board page listing all job offers
  * A submission form providing the option to submit a new job offer
  * A dashboard page for administrators to be able to see all jobs submissions, being able to edit and 
    delete entries

* PHP a
* Simple database having only 2 or 3 tables for having the job offers. (MySQL is best in this case)
* LAMP/XAMPP/WAMP stack for the server + connection between PHP and MySQL in order to perform basic CRUD operations - save the data into the database, write, and read the information from it.

## Results
The end result of the work should cover the following:

- [ ] Having a submissions form for submitting job offers. A single offer must have:
- [ ] Title
- [ ] Description
- [ ] Company
- [ ] Salary field
- [ ] Having a list of submitted offers
- [ ] Having a simple administrative panel listing job offers and being able to delete and edit offers
- [ ] Having a README.md file in the Git repository explaining the required setup for the project and short - [ ] information about the project
- [ ] An export of your final database for reviewing the structure and the data

### Bonus points âœ¨
1. Having an option to approve/reject submissions from the administrative panel
2. Having an option to search by a keyword for jobs
3. Having a paginated listing page, being able to go to page 2, page 3, etc
